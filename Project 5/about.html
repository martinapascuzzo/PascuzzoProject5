        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>As an international student from Argentina, I am eager to provide a different worldview to the work environment, learn, and discover all the experiences available for my future career.</p>
        <p>I have had pertinent graphic design, web design, and social media management experience as well as some customer experience when I reached out to clients while developing my own business plan and strategy for a personal dessert-making enterprise that I ran back in Argentina called <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mardetentaciones/">“Mar de Tentaciones”</a>. I have taken three major specific classes like Media Design, Intro to Advertising, and Intro to Design. On top of that, I have personal and professional  experience as a photographer for The Missourian and I am part of the Leader Group (exec. board) of AdInk as well as a  volunteer for the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/2203860554/permalink/10158455944000555/">Social Media and Graphic Design Committee </a>for which I regularly post on Facebook and design flyers. </p>
